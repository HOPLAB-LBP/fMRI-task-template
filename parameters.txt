% Parameters for a MATLAB script
% This file contains the parameters to be used in another matlab script.
% It will be parsed according to these rules:
% - all lines beginning with '%' will be ignored, use them to comment
% - all empty lines will be ignored
% - all other lines will be read as matlab code
% 
% Enter your parameters in this format: "name = value".
%
% Write whatever you want in this file. As long as it is preceded by a '%' sign at the beginning of the line, it won't be read by MatLab.
% Write all your parameters in uncommented lines, and they will be read as code.
