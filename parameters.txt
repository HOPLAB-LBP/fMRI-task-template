% Parameters for a MATLAB script
% This file contains the parameters to be used in another matlab script.
% It will be parsed according to these rules:
% - all lines beginning with '%' will be ignored, use them to comment
% - all empty lines will be ignored
% - all other lines will be read as matlab code
% 
% Enter your parameters in this format: "name = value".
%
% Write whatever you want in this file. As long as it is preceded by a '%' sign at the beginning of the line, it won't be read by MatLab.
% Write all your parameters in uncommented lines, and they will be read as code.

% Define parameters related to stimuli presentation and trial structure

fixSize = [.6 .5 .1]; % Fixation cross size
stimDur = 2.5; % Duration each stimulus is displayed, in seconds
fixDur = 1; % Duration of the fixation cross display (ISI/response window), in seconds
prePost = 10; % Duration before the first stimulus and after the last stimulus, in seconds
trialDur = p.stimDur + p.fixDur; % Total duration of each trial, in seconds
imSize = round(convertVisualUnits(8, 'deg', 'px')); % Convert stimulus size from visual degrees to pixels

% Define parameters for the stimuli and experimental conditions
numStim = 40; % Total number of stimuli
% Number of stimuli per condition. Adjust these as per your stimuli set
numStimC1 = 3; p.numStimC2 = 4; p.numStimC3 = 7; p.numStimC4 = 3; p.numStimC5 = 3;
stimCat = {'C1','C2','C3','C4','C5','NC1','NC2','NC3','NC4','NC5'}; % Categories of stimuli
numCon = 10; % Number of conditions
numTrials = p.numStim * 2; % Total number of trials (each stimulus presented twice)
